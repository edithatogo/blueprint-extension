- `/blueprint-define`: Turn `PLAN.md` into a task checklist in `TODO.md`.
- `/blueprint-implement`: Execute `TODO.md` and log work in `ACT.md`.
- `/blueprint-test`: Create/execute a test plan and log to `TEST.md`.
- `/blueprint-refine`: Incorporate feedback or fix failures across prior steps.
- `/blueprint-resume`: Detect current workflow state and recommend next steps.
- `/blueprint-clear`: Find and delete workflow-generated files (with confirmation).
