# Antigravity Workflows: Blueprint

These Markdown files are intended to be used as Antigravity Workflows (invoked via `/workflow-name`).

## Core Workflows

- `/blueprint-research`: Research a topic and write `RESEARCH.md`.
- `/blueprint-plan`: Create an implementation plan in `PLAN.md`.
- `/blueprint-define`: Turn `PLAN.md` into a task checklist in `TODO.md`.
- `/blueprint-implement`: Execute `TODO.md` and log work in `ACT.md`.
- `/blueprint-test`: Create/execute a test plan and log to `TEST.md`.

## Iteration Workflows

- `/blueprint-refine`: Incorporate feedback or fix failures across prior steps.
- `/blueprint-resume`: Detect current workflow state and recommend next steps.

## Utility Workflows

- `/blueprint-commit`: Stage, commit, and push changes with a conventional commit message.
- `/blueprint-review`: Run a self-review checklist before finalizing work.
- `/blueprint-branch`: Isolate work in a new Git branch with optional task directory.
- `/blueprint-clear`: Find and delete workflow-generated files (with confirmation).
