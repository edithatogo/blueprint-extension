# BMJ (British Medical Journal)

## Scope & Mission
Publishes clinical research of international importance, with emphasis on studies that can improve healthcare outcomes.

## Manuscript Limits
| Element | Limit |
|---------|-------|
| Main text | 3,000 words |
| Abstract | 250 words (structured) |
| Figures/Tables | 5 combined |
| References | 30 |

## Emphasis Areas
- **Clinical relevance**: Direct implications for practice
- **Patient outcomes**: Focus on outcomes that matter to patients
- **Generalizability**: Applicable beyond study setting
- **Transparency**: Complete reporting, pre-registration

## Common Rejection Reasons
- No clear clinical implications
- Single-center studies with limited generalizability
- Surrogate outcomes without patient-relevant endpoints
- Incomplete reporting
- Studies without pre-registration (for trials)
- Methodological concerns

## Review Priorities
1. Will this change clinical practice?
2. Is the study adequately powered?
3. Are the outcomes clinically meaningful?
4. Is the study pre-registered (if applicable)?
5. Are there conflicts of interest concerns?
