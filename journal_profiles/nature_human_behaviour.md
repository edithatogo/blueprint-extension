# Nature Human Behaviour

## Scope & Mission
Publishes research of outstanding significance into any aspect of human behavior. Spans social sciences, psychology, economics, public health, and related fields.

## Manuscript Limits
| Element | Limit |
|---------|-------|
| Main text | ~5,000 words |
| Methods | Detailed (no limit) |
| Figures | 6 main + Extended Data |
| References | ~60 |
| Abstract | 150 words, no references |

## Emphasis Areas
- **Behavioral significance**: Must advance understanding of human behavior
- **Methodological rigor**: Appropriate methods for claims
- **Replicability**: Pre-registration, power analysis, transparancy
- **Cross-disciplinary appeal**: Interest beyond single field
- **Real-world relevance**: Implications for policy/practice

## Common Rejection Reasons
- "Limited behavioral insight" - insufficient conceptual advance
- "Narrow audience" - too specialized
- Underpowered studies
- Post-hoc analyses without pre-registration
- WEIRD sample bias without acknowledgment
- Overstated conclusions

## Review Priorities
1. Does this significantly advance understanding of human behavior?
2. Are the methods appropriate for the claims?
3. Was the study pre-registered (or adequately justified if not)?
4. Is there appropriate power/sample size?
5. Are limitations (e.g., WEIRD samples) addressed?
