# PLOS ONE

## Scope & Mission
Publishes primary research from any discipline within science and medicine. Focuses on technical soundness rather than perceived impact.

## Manuscript Limits
| Element | Limit |
|---------|-------|
| Main text | No strict limit (be concise) |
| Abstract | 300 words max |
| Figures | No limit (reasonable) |
| References | No limit |

## Emphasis Areas
- **Technical soundness**: Methods must be rigorous
- **Reproducibility**: Detailed methods, data sharing
- **Reporting standards**: CONSORT, STROBE, PRISMA etc.
- **Open data**: Strong expectation for data availability

## Common Rejection Reasons
- Insufficient methodological detail
- Lack of appropriate controls
- Statistical analysis concerns
- Missing ethics approval
- Data not made available
- Conclusions not supported by results

## Review Priorities
1. Is the study technically sound?
2. Are the methods described in sufficient detail?
3. Are the conclusions supported by the data?
4. Does the study meet relevant reporting guidelines?
5. Is the data available or will it be upon publication?

## Formatting Notes
- Structured abstract (Background, Methods, Results, Conclusions)
- ORCID required for corresponding author
- Data availability statement mandatory
- Funding statement mandatory
- Competing interests statement mandatory
- Reporting checklist may be required (CONSORT, STROBE, etc.)

## Impact Note
PLOS ONE does **not** assess perceived significance or impact. A methodologically sound study will not be rejected for being "incremental" or "of limited interest."
