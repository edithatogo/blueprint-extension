# Nature

## Scope & Mission
Publishes significant advances of interest to scientists across disciplines. The primary criterion is scientific quality and novelty.

## Manuscript Limits
| Element | Limit |
|---------|-------|
| Main text | ~3,000 words (excluding Methods) |
| Methods | ~3,000 words |
| Figures | 4-6 main + Extended Data |
| References | ~50 |
| Abstract | 150 words max, no references |

## Emphasis Areas
- **Novelty**: Must represent a substantial advance
- **Broad impact**: Appeal beyond specialist audience
- **Rigor**: Exceptional methodological quality
- **Reproducibility**: Strong data/code availability expectations

## Common Rejection Reasons
- "Incremental advance" - not paradigm-shifting enough
- "Specialist interest only" - too narrow for Nature audience
- "Lack of mechanistic insight" - descriptive without explanation
- "Insufficient data" - claims not fully supported
- "Technical concerns" - methodological weaknesses

## Review Priorities
1. Is this a major advance that will interest a broad audience?
2. Are the conclusions fully supported by the data?
3. Is the study design appropriate and rigorous?
4. Are there any ethical concerns?

## Formatting Notes
- No bold/italic in abstract
- Figure legends must be self-contained
- Methods must enable replication
- Data availability statement required
- Code availability statement required
